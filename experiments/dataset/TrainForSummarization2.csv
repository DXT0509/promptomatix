"Kevin Carr set off from Haytor, Devon in July 2013 completing one to two marathons a day. The route included deserts, arctic climes, high altitude mountains and covered 26,232km (16,299 miles). His challenge was to become the fastest person to run around the world. The attempt is yet to be ratified by the World Running Association. The previous record was set by Tom Denniss of Australia who also ran across 20 countries on five continents. Speaking on his return to Devon following his 621 days of running, Mr Carr said: ""I'm overwhelmed. It was an amazing finish, the support and turnout was incredible. ""It's been an incredibly huge strain these last few weeks to get here in time to do the record. It was never meant to come down to this much of a nail biter. ""I had numerous set backs. I broke the record by less than one day."" The challenge saw the fitness instructor run across: Europe, India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, USA, South America and Ireland. Along the way he had to avoid snakes, scorpions, wild dogs, wolves, bears and mountain lions. Mr Carr said he saw 26 bears in five weeks during the trip: ""One actually stalked me and that was probably the most terrifying moment of my life,"" he said. Through his late teens and early 20s the runner said he suffered with depression and went through a bad suicide attempt so wanted to compete the feat to raise money for mental health charity SANE and the British Red Cross.",A man who has run around the world in 19 months has completed his world record attempt.
"Footage showed Laxman Savadi apparently watching a clip on a phone and sharing it with his colleague, CC Patil, the minister for women and children. Another minister, Krishna Palemar, the phone's reported owner, also quit. The pair denied watching porn but said they quit to prevent embarrassment to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. There was public outrage after news channels ran the story on Tuesday evening, and opposition parties demanded the resignation of the ministers. ""I have resigned to prevent any embarrassment to the party. All three of us will prove our innocence,"" Mr Savadi said. An inquiry has been ordered. The footage of the ministers was captured by news channels positioned in the media galleries during a debate in the state assembly. It shows Mr Savadi, the minister for co-operation, watching a clip on a mobile phone and then showing it to Mr Patil. The clip appeared to show a woman dancing, undressing and then having sex. ""Why should I resign?"" Mr Savadi asked on Tuesday. ""The video I watched was of a woman being raped by four people. It was not porn."" He said he was watching the footage to ""prepare for a discussion [in the assembly] on the ill-effects of a rave party"" in the state recently. Mr Patil told reporters: ""We are not so uncivilised as to watch porn films."" Mr Palemar, the state minister for ports and environment, said his innocence would be proved by the inquiry. Correspondents say the incident has come as a major embarrassment for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party government. The government has already been rocked by corruption scandals, leading to the resignation of former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa last year.",Two ministers in the Indian state of Karnataka have resigned after they were accused of watching pornography in the state assembly.
"Tornagrain is being built on farmland near Inverness and those behind the project say it will eventually grow into a community of 12,000 people. The concept has been more than 10 years in the making and is being led by landowner the Earl of Moray. It is modelled on planned villages of the 18th and 19th Centuries. Tornagrain's homes will range from large townhouses to small flats. Shops, premises for other businesses and green spaces will also be constructed in phases. Among the first families to move in are Madeline and Jonathan Hewitt and their daughter Millie. Highland Council's planning, environment and development committee voted 17 to three in favour of the project in 2012. The project had been the source of a row at a previous council meeting when councillors were told they could not have a vote on whether it should be given planning permission in principle. At the meeting officials said that there were no valid grounds to reject the new town because the project was in the council's development plan. This prompted an angry reaction from some councillors. The project was then later brought back before the committee to be debated and voted on. In 2015, when the first work began on the new town, the developers said it could take up to 60 years to complete the overall project.",Residents have begun moving in to what developers claim is the first new town to be built in Scotland for more than 50 years.

"The environmental group has parked the double-decker at Westminster. It will cover the bus, which featured the controversial claim leaving the EU could boost the NHS by £350m a week, with questions for the government. Singer Will Young and Pakistan's cricket team are reportedly among those to have previously hired the bus since the 23 June referendum. This meant Greenpeace had to reinstate Vote Leave's branding after acquiring the bus, which carried Leave campaigners including Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Gisela Stuart around the campaign trail, before launching its ""come clean"" publicity stunt.","Vote Leave's EU referendum bus has been hired by Greenpeace, which plans to rebrand it a ""vehicle for truth""."
