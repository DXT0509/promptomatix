A box of six popsicles was left out in the sun and is slowly melting. Every time a popsicle melts the remaining popsicles melt twice as fast as the previous one. How many times faster than the first popsicle does the last popsicle’s remains melt?,The remains of the second popsicle melt 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 times as fast as the first. The remains of the third popsicle melt 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 times as fast as the first. The remains of the fourth popsicle melt 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 times as fast as the first. The remains of the fifth popsicle melt 2 * 8 = 16 times as fast as the first. The remains of the sixth popsicle melt 2 * 16 = <<2*16=32>>32 times as fast as the first popsicle. #### 32
"A long wire is cut into three smaller pieces in the ratio of 7:3:2. If the shortest piece is 16 cm, how long was the entire wire before it was cut?","Since the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm. The whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = <<7+3+2=12>>12 parts. Hence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = <<8*12=96>>96 cm long #### 96"

"There are enough provisions in a castle to feed 300 people for 90 days. After 30 days, 100 people leave the castle. How many more days are left until all the food runs out?","After 30 days, there will be enough food left to sustain 300 people for 90 days – 30 days = 60 days. After the 100 people leave, there will be 300-100 = <<300-100=200>>200 people left. The 200 people will eat 200/300 = 2/3 as much food as the original group of people in the castle.

"Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times Benedict's house. If Kennedy's house is 10000 square feet, how many square feet is Benedict's house?","Let the number of square feet in Benedict's house be x. So, we can write the equation 4 * x + 600 = 10000. Subtracting 600 from both sides we get 4 * x = 9400 Dividing both sides by 4 we get x = 2350 square feet. #### 2350"
