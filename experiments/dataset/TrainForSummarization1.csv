"The first time Susan Vasey knew of a £10,000 loan in her name was when police arrested her, she told a jury at Worcester Crown Court. On hearing the recorded call she recognised the caller as her ex. Matthew Samuels, of St Johns, Worcester denies 11 counts of fraud. The 50-year-old, of Broadway Grove, is accused of tricking five women and his own stepson out of about £180,000. Divorced Miss Vasey met Mr Samuels on dating site MatchAffinity.com when he was living in Staffordshire. She told the jury he helped her get a finance deal on a Vauxhall Corsa through a car dealership he worked with. But she claimed that, in early 2013, Mr Samuels told her the remaining £6,000 on the hire purchase agreement was due immediately. Miss Vasey said she went to her bank and arranged a loan to buy the car outright but handed the money to Mr Samuels, who was to make the payment. She claimed that in September last year she discovered paperwork showing the car had never been paid for and about £4,000 was outstanding on the original hire purchase deal. She said: ""I didn't know what had happened to the £6,000, I only knew it hadn't been used to settle the finance on the car."" The trial of Mr Samuels continues.","A man accused of a £180,000 online dating scam feigned laryngitis over the phone to dupe a bank into giving him a loan in his girlfriend's name, a court has heard."

Speed is the key as well. ""When you have his speed, they don't see the punches coming. And that will be the plan for Klitschko, that he just can't avoid or defend what's coming from Anthony. ""He's looking forward to it. He's enjoying his boxing. The tests lie ahead but he's in a great place and we're more than confident that he'll beat Klitschko."" McCracken watched at Manchester Arena on Saturday as the Watford-born fighter stopped American Molina in the third round. Promoter Eddie Hearn then announced that Joshua would fight Klitschko at Wembley Arena on 29 April, by which time the Ukrainian will be 41. ""Klitschko is a different type of test,"" McCracken said. ""Klitschko won't be fazed - he's hugely experienced. ""He knows his way around, he knows how to jab and grab and nullify big punchers. He's beaten big punchers before, but I think Anthony's more than a big puncher."" Klitschko became free to fight Joshua for the WBA and IBF belts after Tyson Fury relinquished his titles in October. Britain's Fury, who beat Klitschko to win the WBA and WBO titles in November 2015, had twice pulled out of scheduled rematches.

"The Farc rebel group relied on cocaine production to fund its insurgency, and controlled much of the industry. But a joint programme between rebels and the government will offer farmers monthly payments if they voluntarily destroy their crops. They will also be offered loans and guidance to plant alternatives such as fruit trees and cacao. The crop substitution programme was agreed as part of Colombia's peace accord, which was finally ratified in December. The Colombian official responsible for the programme, Rafael Pardo, said the government would invest $340m (Â£271m), which would benefit 50,000 families. Last year, President Juan Manuel Santos decided to suspend US-backed aerial fumigation of illegal coca crops. The government has set a goal of destroying 100,000 hectares of coca this year, and has yet to rule out other methods to bring coca levels down. But the preferred strategy appears to be winning over the estimated 64,000 peasant families dependent on the coca trade. ""This is much more cost-efficient and furthermore ensures that territories are transformed and people's lives are changed,"" Mr Pardo said. Each family would receive a monthly stipend of around $350 (Â£280) as well as loans, subsidies, and technical assistance. The programme is supported by the Farc and will initially focus on 40 municipalities responsible for more than half of Colombia's coca production. During the armed conflict, the Farc initially taxed farmers producing coca in areas under its control, but eventually dominated trafficking in those areas. As the Farc leave these regions to comply with the peace accord, the concern is that other armed groups including paramilitary and other crime gangs will try to replace them and take over the trade.","Colombia has announced a plan to eradicate vast crops of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine."
"Eyewitnesses report that one bomber blew himself up as worshippers left the mosque, before a car bomb was set off as people came to help the casualties. On Twitter, Islamic State militants claimed they had carried out the attack. Earlier in the day, two aid workers were shot dead in northern Yemen. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said that two of its local aid workers were killed as they travelled in a convoy to Sanaa.

IS militants have claimed a series of suicide bombings against Houthi targets in recent months. The mosque is in a neighbourhood that supports the Houthi rebels, who seized the capital in February. Fighting in Yemen has escalated since a Saudi-led coalition intervened militarily against the Houthi rebels at the end of March.
