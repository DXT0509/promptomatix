"Christopher, Jameson, and June each bought a toy sword. June's sword is 5 inches longer than Jameson's sword. Jameson's sword is 3 inches longer than twice the length of Christopher's sword. Christopher's sword is 15 inches long. How many inches longer is June's sword than Christopher's sword?","Twice the length of Christopher's sword is 15 x 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 inches. So, Jameson's sword is 30 + 3 = <<30+3=33>>33 inches long. June's sword is 33 + 5 = <<33+5=38>>38 inches long. Thus, June's sword is 38 - 15 = <<38-15=23>>23 inches longer than Christopher's sword. #### 23"
"The total average age of three friends is 40. Jared is ten years older than Hakimi, and Molly's age is 30. How old is Hakimi?","The total age for the three friends is 40*3 = <<40*3=120>>120 If Molly's age is 30, then Jared and Hakimi have a total age of 120-30 = 90. Let's say the age of Hakimi is x. Since Jared is 10 years older than Hakimi, Jared is x+10 years old. Jared and Hakimi's total age is x+(x+10) = 90 This translates to 2x=90-10 2x=80 Hakimi's age is x=80/2 This gives us x=<<40=40>>40, which is Hamkimi's age. #### 40"

On a particular day, he counted 100 tents in the northernmost part of the campsite and twice that number on the east side of the grounds. The number of tents at the center of the camp was four times the number of tents in the northernmost part of the campsite. If he also counted 200 tents in the southern part of the campsite, what is the total number of tents in the recreation area?","On the eastern part of the campsite, Mr Manuel counted 2*100 = <<2*100=200>>200 tents The total number of tents in the eastern and the northern part of the campgrounds is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300 There are four times as many tents as the northernmost part in the central part of the campsite, which means there are 4*100 = <<4*100=400>>400 tents in the central part of the camp. The total number of tents in the three parts of the campsite is 400+300 = <<400+300=700>>700 If you add the number of tents Mr. Manuel counted at the southern part of the campsite, you get 700+200 = <<700+200=900>>900 tents on the whole campsite #### 900"
"In a house of 15, 3/5 of the people eat pizza. If Aviana brought pizza with 50 pieces, and each person eating pizza took 4 pieces, calculate the number of pizza pieces that remained.","If there are 15 people in the house, the number of people eating pizza is 3/5*15 = <<3/5*15=9>>9 people. If each house member who eats pizza took four pieces to eat, the number of pieces taken is 4*9 = <<4*9=36>>36 pieces. Since the total number of pieces was 50, the number of pieces not taken is 50-36 = <<50-36=14>>14 pieces. #### 14"
