"Former civil servant Sir John Chilcot will appear before MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee on 18 October. The report, which took seven years to complete, criticised Tony Blair and his government's case for going to war in 2003. Mr Blair defended his actions, saying military action had been justified. The Chilcot Inquiry, which began its work in 2009, after UK troops left Iraq, did not attempt to reach a verdict on the legality or otherwise of the military action. Mr Blair has continued to insist the decision to remove Saddam Hussein was justified, although he has acknowledged that the intelligence on which it was based was flawed. Appearing before a separate committee of MPs last month, Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heyward said he and other civil servants were in the ""preliminary"" phase of learning lessons from the report in terms of how government should operate in future. He said he was frustrated at the length of time the inquiry had taken but believed that it could not have been expedited without changing the large terms of reference or restricting access to vital declassified documents and other material. The liaison committee, made up of the chairs of individual parliamentary committees, is best known for questioning the prime minister of the day two or three times a year.",MPs will question the chairman of the Iraq War Inquiry later this month for the first time since it published its official report in July.
"They include a new water sports park, railway station and a sliproad from the M77. The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about £1bn from the UK and Scottish governments. The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash. The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year. Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world. A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there. Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead. A wide range of other infrastructure projects across the eight council areas will also be discussed.",Some of the first projects to be funded by the City Deal programme for the west of Scotland are to be discussed by councillors.

"Snapchat confirmed the figure following a report in the Financial Times. Last week, Facebook said it was now registering eight billion views a day of video material posted on its social media network. However, different platforms do not use the same criteria when counting views - Facebook counts videos viewed for three seconds or longer. YouTube only charges advertisers if a video is viewed for 30 seconds, and while Snapchat does not say how long a video must play in order to count, a recent report said advertisers were being charged even if their ad was viewed for less than one second. According to Snapchat, more than 60% of 13- to 34 year-old smartphone owners in the US use the service, which is available only on mobile platforms.

"In a statement, the company said the move will hit next year's profit by about £15m. In addition, if the pound averages $1.20 over the financial year, it may lose another £20m. Overnight on Friday the pound temporarily plunged by 6%, in a flash crash that is thought to have been triggered by automated trading. Shares in Sports Direct closed down 9% on Friday. The company had expected to report underlying profit of £300m based on the pound trading at $1.30 against the dollar. However, the retailer said that ""extreme movements overnight"" would result ""in a negative impact of approximately £15m"" on its results for the current financial year. The swings overnight hit the company's hedging arrangements, which are designed to protect a business against volatile currency prices. It also sustained a large loss in its last financial year because of currency movements. In that case, because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, it took a £65m hit. As a result, Sports Direct reported underlying earnings of £381.4m for the year to 24 April against expectations of £420m, resulting in staff missing out on a bonus. It has been a tumultuous year for Sports Direct which has been criticised for working conditions at its Shirebrook distribution centre.

"The comedy sequel earned more in its first weekend than the $65m that the first film pulled in over the course of its entire US run in cinemas. Universal's Nick Carpou described the musical sequel's success as ""amazing"". Directed by actress Elizabeth Banks, it marks the highest ever opening for a first-time feature film director. ""People loved the first movie and it resonated well beyond that $65m that the first film did,"" said Carpou, Universal's domestic distribution chief. ""To be able to build on the first film and expand its popularity is pretty amazing."" The film sees Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson reprising their original roles, alongside newcomer Hailee Steinfeld, as the fictional a capella singing group The Barden Bellas. The story sees the Bellas square off against German aca-champions Das Sound Machine in an international singing contest. Tom Hardy's turn as the reinvented Mad Max - filling the shoes of Mel Gibson 30 years on - racked up $44.4m, having received positive reviews when it premiered at Cannes Film Festival last week. ""A lot of people coming to the movie went purely on the reviews,"" said Warner Bros' Dan Fellman, calling the film ""an incredible ride this is that it's going to propel us right into the meat of the summer"". However the film remains a long way from profit. Pitch Perfect 2 cost a modest $29m to produce, while Mad Max: Fury Road carries a significant $150m price tag.","Pitch Perfect 2 has made an impressive $70.3m (£44.7m) debut at the US box office, surging ahead of George Miller's Mad Max reboot, Fury Road."
"It is thought the body was dumped some time between 21:00 BST and midnight on Sunday, just off the A628 at Tintwistle, near Glossop, Derbyshire. Police are liaising with Europol, as the unidentified victim could be a foreign national. A member of the public discovered the remains on Monday. At a press conference, a police spokesman said a witness saw a fire close to the road on Sunday. Live updates and more from Derbyshire. Assistant Chief Constable Bill McWilliam told reporters he was ""pretty satisfied this poor individual"" was not murdered in the lay-by. Mr McWilliam said: ""We are working with other forces to ascertain whether our victim may have been reported missing in a neighbouring county but we recognise he might not have been reported missing at all. ""I recognise this must be a very shocking incident for either people who live in the area or frequent the area for recreation."" Post-mortem examinations revealed the body belonged to a white man under the age of 50, but no DNA matches have been found on the national database. The cause of death is still unknown. Police have urged anyone who may have information about the man's identity to contact them.

A murder inquiry began on Tuesday after the man's remains were found, led by officers from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit.","The badly burned body of a man found in a lay-by near the Peak District had its head and limbs missing and was stuffed in a suitcase, police have said."
"As he was in the summer, the 38-year-old has again been linked with the vacant national job following the departure of Sam Allardyce on Tuesday. Howe guided Bournemouth to Premier League safety last season after winning the Championship title in 2015.

"Notts leg-spinner Imran Tahir led the recovery with 7-112 as Somerset were all out for 437 - a lead of 36. Resuming on 244-3, South Africa international Tahir claimed six of the seven Somerset wickets to fall on a scorching day - including Trescothick, who added 101 to his overnight 117. Notts lost Steven Mullaney and Michael Lumb early, before closing on 58-2. Trescothick, who equalled Somerset's record for the most first-class centuries with his 49th on Monday, was in wonderful form once again despite stifling temperatures. The 40-year-old brought up his double century off 323 balls with a trademark cover drive off Samit Patel - his 31st boundary - before he was the last man to go, chipping Tahir to cover. Somerset looked set for a much bigger lead as Trescothick and Jim Allenby's hundred partnership took them to 379-4 and within 22 of the hosts. But once Allenby was bowled by Patel for 63, Tahir tore through the rest of the batting order as Somerset lost their last five wickets for 37. The procession of afternoon wickets continued in Nottinghamshire's second innings as Craig Overton pinned first-innings centurion Mullaney lbw and Allenby bowled Lumb without scoring in the next over.

"It meant they only managed a single batting point, having begun the game at Beckenham 24 behind leaders Essex. Opener Sean Dickson made 63 as they reached 146-7 before Will Gidman (51) and Matt Coles (52) led a recovery. South African paceman Rory Kleinveldt took 3-70 for the visitors, who had made 31-0 in reply by the close. Kent need to win and hope that leaders Essex slip up against Glamorgan next week before the two meet in the final round of matches. But their first-innings total means they can take no more than 20 points from the game, so Essex will only need 21 from their two remaining fixtures to clinch the Division Two title. The day's statistical high point came when Gidman was caught by Kleinveldt off spinner Graeme White, his first dismissal for Kent after three unbeaten half centuries, giving him an average of 283. Northants were left to face 11 overs in the final session and Ben Duckett (19 not out) and Rob Newton came through them unscathed.",Kent suffered a blow to their promotion hopes as they were bowled out for 230 on the opening day of their penultimate Championship game against Northants.
"The court upheld a Chilean prison sentence for Hartmut Hopp, a German citizen in his seventies. Hopp worked with Paul Sch√§fer, a former Nazi soldier who founded the commune in southern Chile 1961. Residents were indoctrinated and kept as virtual slaves for more than 30 years. Hopp's lawyer says he will appeal against the sentence. Sch√§fer also collaborated with the government of Augusto Pinochet whose secret police used the colony around 350km (215 miles) south of the capital, Santiago, as a place of torture and to ""disappear"" his opponents. Germany last year said it would declassify its files on the sect, and the foreign minister at the time, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, admitted that the diplomatic service had failed to stop the abuses. The scale of the abuses only came to light after Sch√§fer faced a series of lawsuits in 1997. He fled Chile and was arrested in Argentina in 2005.

"Rita Wharton died when her car was hit after Anita Corless tried to overtake traffic near Welshpool, Powys. Corless, 58, originally from Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire, admitted causing death by dangerous driving. She was given a 16-month prison sentence at Mold Crown Court. The driving instructor said she had no memory of the fatal manoeuvre on the A483 road between Welshpool and Pool Quay, last March. The court heard on Tuesday how she was in a line of traffic on a straight stretch of road when she pulled out but there was insufficient room and she caused the crash. Mrs Wharton's Ford Ka, the second in line, was struck by two vehicles. A widow, said to be the lynchpin of the family, Mrs Wharton was declared dead at the scene. ""You quite inexplicably drove your vehicle into the face of on-coming traffic in an overtaking manoeuvre that was obviously dangerous,"" said Judge Niclas Parry. ""On-coming vehicles should have been visible to a careful driver. ""You are by profession a driving instructor, employed by Lancashire County Council to run speed awareness courses."" Speed awareness courses are offered by councils and police forces across Britain to avoid penalties for minor speeding offences. Corless, who was living in Bentham in North Yorkshire at the time of the incident, was herself seriously injured in the crash. The judge told her it was a thoroughly-avoidable fatality which ""must be marked by a custodial sentence"". In addition to the 16-month jail sentence, Corless was banned from driving for two-years and eight-months, and must take an extended driving test before being allowed back on the roads. The court was told that, despite her age, Mrs Wharton still worked as the head housekeeper at a pub in Powys, and lived her life like a woman in her 50s.

"Officials said the 1.14 litre bottles of Bombay Sapphire London Dry Gin should have had 40% alcohol content by volume when the actual figure was 77%. They said the problem had been traced back to the production line. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said no illnesses associated with the gin had been reported. Drinks giant Bacardi, which distributes Bombay Sapphire, said the affected batch was believed to have only been sold in Canada. The province of Ontario was the first to remove the gin from stores before a nationwide recall was issued. ""One batch was bottled before correct dilution to achieve the stated 40% alcohol content by volume,"" the Ontario Liquor Control Board said in a statement ""As a result, the affected batch has alcohol content by volume of 77%."" The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said the recalled gin should be thrown out or returned to the shop where it was bought.

"Thermal cameras detected higher temperatures in three adjacent stones at the bottom of the Great Pyramid. Officials said possible causes included the existence of empty areas inside the pyramid, internal air currents, or the use of different building materials. It comes as experts search for hidden chambers within the pyramids. The tombs of the pharaohs Khufu (Kheops), Khafre (Khephren) and Menkaure (Mycerinus) were built in the Fourth Dynasty, about 2613-2494BC. A team of architects and scientists from Egypt, France, Canada and Japan used infrared thermography to survey the pyramids during sunrise, as the sun heats the limestone structures from the outside, as well as at sunset when they cool down. In a statement, the Egyptian antiquities ministry said the experts had ""concluded the existence of several thermal anomalies that were observed on all monuments during the heating-up or the cooling-down phases"". ""To explain such anomalies, a lot of hypotheses and possibilities could be drawn up: presence of voids behind the surface, internal air currents,"" it added. An ""particularly impressive"" anomaly was found at ground level on the eastern side of the Great Pyramid, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, the statement said. ""The first row of the pyramid's stones are all uniform, then we come here and find that there's a difference in the formation,"" Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-Damati said as he showed reporters the three stones showing higher temperatures. Other thermal anomalies were detected in the upper half of the Great Pyramid. The structure will be the subject of further investigation during the Operation Scan Pyramids project, which began on 25 October and is expected to last until the end of 2016.","An international team of architects and scientists have observed ""thermal anomalies"" in the pyramids of Giza, Egyptian antiquities officials say."
"Customers who pay via direct debit often receive bills based on estimated meter readings. When an actual reading is taken, the company ""back-bills"" the customer for any shortfall between payments and the energy used. Citizens Advice says that the bills hit thousands of pounds in some cases. Its research last year showed that as many as 2.1 million consumers a year receive some sort of catch up bill, at an average of ¬£206. In 2007, energy suppliers signed a voluntary commitment promising not to back-bill domestic customers for energy used more than 12 months previously, if the supplier was at fault. The expansion of the market has led to concerns that some are not keeping to this agreement, and regulator Ofgem wants to write it into the rules by the winter. ""We expect suppliers to put their customers first, which is why we are proposing a new enforceable rule to provide this protection,"" said Rachel Fletcher, senior partner at Ofgem. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""Shock gas and electricity bills can throw people's finances into disarray. ""We helped one person who received a bill for over ¬£3,000 after their energy company stopped taking their direct debit payment but didn't tell the customer. The firm refused to apply the 12 month back-bill limit, leaving the customer to pay the full bill. ""We've long been calling on the regulator to introduce a mandatory time limit for back bills instead of relying on voluntary action, which suppliers have refused to apply in some cases."" The regulator is planning to reduce the back bill time limit when more accurate smart meters become the norm in homes. Citizens Advice is calling for this deadline to be reduced to three months.","Energy firms will be banned from charging catch-up bills for gas and electricity used more than 12 months earlier, under the regulator's plans."
