GSK said it would adopt a graduated approach linked to a country's wealth. It said it would still seek full patent protection in richer nations. The company says the changes it is making should help people who currently cannot afford life saving medicine. In the world's poorest countries, it will allow other companies to make generics or cheaper copies of its medicine. In what it calls lower middle income countries it will continue to file patents but will grant licences to generic manufacturers in exchange for a royalty. Pharmaceutical firms are often criticised for not making their medicines affordable to people in developing countries, but the firms have argued that patenting their products is the only way to ensure research for new treatments can be funded. One exception is HIV/AIDS, where the price of drugs for people in many poor nations who are living with the condition have been drastically reduced. Sufferers of other serious illnesses though, for example, cancer, often cannot afford the drugs to treat them.

This included: The study said: ""A large proportion of children under 11 years old in most of the countries do not have the the freedom to get about their local area. ""Even the oldest children are restricted in what they are allowed to do, at an age when many of the rights of adulthood are close to being granted, including the right to drive vehicles on the road once the test has been passed.""

The unnamed acquirers have made a $5m down payment for exclusive rights to the deal, YGM said in its annual report this week. Chinese textile firm Shandong Ruyi Group is understood to be one of the buyers, according to Bloomberg. Aquascutum started as a Mayfair tailors in 1851, rising to prominence after its founder, John Emary, patented the first waterproof textile.

The Taliban have made gains since international troops withdrew from an active fighting role in 2014. Nato forces are increasingly being deployed in battle zones to support Afghan forces fighting the Taliban.

But after days of heavy rain, a ""tidal wave"" of flood water swept through the garden in the early hours of Saturday. It came as floods caused ""chaos"" across north Wales. Former farmer Mr Tavernor has been restoring the 10-acres of garden and buildings at Plas Cadnant since buying the then overgrown 200-acre estate in 1996. It now attracts visitors - both local and from abroad - and its fans include the Prince of Wales, who Mr Tavernor said had hoped to visit the estate. But the force of the water from the flooded River Cadnant has now washed away many precious plants, including some rare botanical species. It also demolished a wall dating back some 200 years, as well stone obelisks, platforms and seats. ""The garden sits down in the valley so a huge amount of water came down from the fields like a tidal wave, devastating everything in its path,"" said Mr Tavernor. ""I'm just devastated. This has been my life's project - my purpose in life - for the last 20 years and I live and dream it, ""It's everything. I'm so emotionally involved with the garden. We've had so much support from people since we put the pictures on our Facebook page. It's almost like a bereavement."" But he insisted he would carry on his work, despite the setback, and aimed to open as normal for visitors in February. ""I was hoping to have a legacy for the future generations,"" he added. ""I'm sure a lot of people would abandon it but I'm going to persevere."" Days of rain caused floods which led to roads being closed, trains disrupted and homes evacuated on Boxing Day. Four flood warnings remain in place across north and west Wales, along with dozens of flood alerts.","A historical walled garden has been ""devastated"" by floods which have washed away a 200-year-old wall and rare plants, its owner has said.","{""summary"": ""Anthony Tavernor’s restoration of Plas Cadnant Hidden Gardens was devastated by floods, yet he vows to rebuild and reopen the estate in February.""}",0.5028306245803833

He was caught when the National League for Democracy party, which is forming the new government, made his CV public. It remains to be seen if Kyaw Win remains on the list of cabinet ministers to take office next week. A party spokesman told the BBC that the fake degree did not matter. Confronted by the Myanmar Times newspaper, Kyaw Win admitted the degree was fake. ""I am not going to call myself 'Dr' any more, as I know now that it is a fake university. The PhD on my CV is not a real qualification,"" he told the newspaper. A BBC check found the title still on his LinkedIn page, reports the BBC's Jonah Fisher. Kyaw Win wrote a number of articles on economics and finance using his fake title.

Rees said: ""The surgeons worked hard on Neil's injury... and did a very good job. ""He is comfortable and the surgeons are happy with the operations."" She added: ""While he should make a full recovery, the extent of the injury means Neil is likely to miss the rest of the season.'' Taylor was injured after falling awkwardly in the first half at the Liberty Stadium. His foot was trapped underneath him as he fell to the ground, taking the full weight of Sunderland's Craig Gardner on the way down. Taylor immediately summoned the Swansea medical staff as he held his left ankle in agony after just 15 minutes of the match. ""When you have injuries like that it is normally very violent, but this was not violent,"" said manager Michael Laudrup. ""It was even a free-kick against us. ""Sometimes these injuries happen in strange ways, you don't think anything is wrong and then there is ligament damage or something like that, it is very sad. ""But you see things that are much more violent than that - this was not violent, it was unlucky. ""He was very unlucky to fall in a bad way, you can't blame the Sunderland player for that.""
