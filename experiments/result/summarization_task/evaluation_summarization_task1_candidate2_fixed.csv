GSK said it would adopt a graduated approach linked to a country's wealth. It said it would still seek full patent protection in richer nations. The company says the changes it is making should help people who currently cannot afford life saving medicine. In the world's poorest countries, it will allow other companies to make generics or cheaper copies of its medicine. In what it calls lower middle income countries it will continue to file patents but will grant licences to generic manufacturers in exchange for a royalty. Pharmaceutical firms are often criticised for not making their medicines affordable to people in developing countries, but the firms have argued that patenting their products is the only way to ensure research for new treatments can be funded. One exception is HIV/AIDS, where the price of drugs for people in many poor nations who are living with the condition have been drastically reduced. Sufferers of other serious illnesses though, for example, cancer, often cannot afford the drugs to treat them. GSK says changes to the way it patents drugs will make its next generation of cancer drugs more affordable. Recent figures showed GSK's sales rose 2% to £6.29bn in the quarter. However, the company fell to a pre-tax loss of £416m compared with a profit of £531m for the same period in 2014.

Freeing children to go out alone in their local area benefited their health and development, the researchers said. Fear over traffic was the top reason for restricting freedom, they added. The children and their parents were surveyed between 2010 and 2012 about what they were allowed to do in their local neighbourhoods without supervision. This included: The study said: ""A large proportion of children under 11 years old in most of the countries do not have the the freedom to get about their local area. ""Even the oldest children are restricted in what they are allowed to do, at an age when many of the rights of adulthood are close to being granted, including the right to drive vehicles on the road once the test has been passed."" Overall, Finland was found to be the top-performing country on independent mobility, with Germany coming second. According to the survey, most Finns can, without supervision: In England, most primary school children are allowed to cross roads without supervision but only 28% to travel home from school and even fewer to go out after dark, travel on local buses or walk to places other than school. Even at secondary school, less than 25% are allowed out alone after dark. Ben Shaw, director of the Policy Studies Institute, said: ""Obviously, we've got to protect children but part of their development is that we allow them to gain independence. ""People see the change from primary school to secondary school as the time to do it, but not having them do it earlier means there is a spike in road accidents at this age.""","Anxious parents in England give their children less freedom to play and go outside than those in many other European countries, research suggests.","{""summary"": ""A University of Westminster study of 18,000 children aged 7‑15 in 16 countries ranked England seventh for child independence, with Finland first and Germany second.
