Answer the question.,Steam_engine,"The Rankine cycle and most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water, so that they may be run continuously. Utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage centrifugal pumps; however, other types are used. Another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an injector, which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler.

Answer the question.,Pharmacy,"This shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in Australia receive remuneration from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education. They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews. In Scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy. Moreover, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation. In addition, consultant pharmacists, who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of ""senior care pharmacy.""",Who can't pay Australian pharmacists for doing Home Medicines Reviews?,No answer,"{""answer"": ""Only the Australian Government pays pharmacists for Home Medicines Reviews – patients themselves can’t make those payments.""}",0.0182972997426986
Answer the question.,Islamism,"Another of the Egyptian groups which employed violence in their struggle for Islamic order was al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (Islamic Group).

Answer the question.,Geology,"In the 1960s, a series of discoveries, the most important of which was seafloor spreading, showed that the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle, is separated into a number of tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere. There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle: oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction, because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle. This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics.",What are the lithosphere and asthenosphere called when coupled together?,No answer,"{""answer"": ""The rigid lithosphere (crust + upper‑mantle) resting on the underlying, plastic asthenosphere behaves as a single physical entity that moves across the convecting mantle.

Answer the question.,Warsaw,"The first fortified settlements on the site of today's Warsaw were located in Bródno (9th/10th century) and Jazdów (12th/13th century). After Jazdów was raided by nearby clans and dukes, a new similar settlement was established on the site of a small fishing village called Warszowa. The Prince of P?ock, Boles?aw II of Masovia, established this settlement, the modern-day Warsaw, in about 1300. In the beginning of the 14th century it became one of the seats of the Dukes of Masovia, becoming the official capital of Masovian Duchy in 1413. 14th-century Warsaw's economy rested on mostly crafts and trade.

Answer the question.,Pharmacy,"In Japan, at the end of the Asuka period (538710) and the early Nara period (710794), the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected. The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the Taih? Code (701) and re-stated in the Y?r? Code (718). Ranked positions in the pre-Heian Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration (1868).

Answer the question.,French_and_Indian_War,"Britain gained control of French Canada and Acadia, colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily French-speaking Roman Catholic residents. The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755 resulted in land made available to migrants from Europe and the colonies further south. The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces, but many went to France, and some went to New Orleans, which they had expected to remain French. Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Islands; these latter efforts were unsuccessful. Others migrated to places like Saint-Domingue, and fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution. The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population.

Answer the question.,Rhine,"Through stream capture, the Rhine extended its watershed southward. By the Pliocene period, the Rhine had captured streams down to the Vosges Mountains, including the Mosel, the Main and the Neckar. The northern Alps were then drained by the Rhone. By the early Pleistocene period, the Rhine had captured most of its current Alpine watershed from the Rhône, including the Aar. Since that time, the Rhine has added the watershed above Lake Constance (Vorderrhein, Hinterrhein, Alpenrhein; captured from the Rhône), the upper reaches of the Main, beyond Schweinfurt and the Vosges Mountains, captured from the Meuse, to its watershed.",How did the Rhine extend watershed southward?,stream capture,"{""answer"": ""The Rhine’s southernward expansion of its drainage basin was accomplished mainly by **stream capture** (also called river piracy).  \nDuring the late Neogene and early Pleistocene the rising Alps and the associated tectonic uplift increased the uplift‑rate and erosion of the surrounding valleys. The Rhine headwaters eroded increasingly far into the valleys that fed the Mosel, Main, Neckar, Aar, and later the Vorderrhein/Hinterrhein (Alpenrhein) and even sections of the Meuse. When the Rhine’s headward erosion overtook the channel of a neighbouring stream, the flowing water was diverted into the Rhine – the stream was “captured.”  \n\nIn this way:\n\n* The Mosel, Main and Neckar were pulled into the Rhine’s stream‑system during the Pliocene.  \n* By the early Pleistocene the Rhine had captured almost its entire current Alpine watershed from the Rhône (including the Aar).  \n* Further headward erosion added the Vor‑, Hinter‑ and Alpenrhein (captured from the Rhône) and portions of the upper Main and the Vosges drainage (captured from the Meuse) to its basin.\n\nHence, the Rhine extended its watershed southward by repeatedly capturing neighboring tributaries through head‑ward erosion and river piracy.""}",0.2142296731472015

Answer the question.,Immune_system,"The adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory, where each pathogen is ""remembered"" by a signature antigen. The adaptive immune response is antigen-specific and requires the recognition of specific ""non-self"" antigens during a process called antigen presentation. Antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells.

Answer the question.,Scottish_Parliament,"For the next three hundred years, Scotland was directly governed by the Parliament of Great Britain and the subsequent Parliament of the United Kingdom, both seated at Westminster, and the lack of a Parliament of Scotland remained an important element in Scottish national identity. Suggestions for a 'devolved' Parliament were made before 1914, but were shelved due to the outbreak of the First World War. A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence, and in 1969 prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution. One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland, within the unitary state of the United Kingdom.

Answer the question.,Imperialism,"The correlation between capitalism, aristocracy, and imperialism has long been debated among historians and political theorists. Much of the debate was pioneered by such theorists as J. A. Hobson (18581940), Joseph Schumpeter (18831950), Thorstein Veblen (18571929), and Norman Angell (18721967). While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the interwar years.

The TEU establishes that European Union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states, as well as certain islands and overseas territories, including Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments. European Union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations, for example Gibraltar and the Åland islands. The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions, as for example done for customs matters in Gibraltar and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. The TEU specifically excludes certain regions, for example the Faroe Islands, from the jurisdiction of European Union law.

Answer the question.,Ctenophora,"On the other hand, in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal  and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism.

Similarly, the sieve of Eratosthenes would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime: a modified version of the sieve that considers 1 as prime would eliminate all multiples of 1 (that is, all other numbers) and produce as output only the single number 1. Furthermore, the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks, such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function or the sum of divisors function.",If 15 were to be considered as prime what would the sieve of Eratosthenes yield for all other numbers?,No answer,"{""answer"": ""**Answer – The sieve would still “produce’’ the ordinary primes.**  \nIf we decided to declare \\(15\\) to be a prime, we would simply add it to the list of prime numbers that the sieve uses as generators when it cross‑offs multiples.  \n\nThe algorithm goes like this:  \n\n1.

Answer the question.,Computational_complexity_theory,"A deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions. A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits. The ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently. Algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms. A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state. One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches, it is said to have solved the problem. Clearly, this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model, it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes.

The machine can read these bits just like it reads the input tape, but unlike the input, the bits are not prescribed by the input description—they are drawn from a uniform distribution.\n\n- **Effect**: At each step the machine may use the next random bit(s) to decide between several possible transitions. The machine still has a single computational path for each choice of the random bits; however, if there exists a sequence of random bits that leads the machine to accept (or otherwise solve the problem) then the machine is considered to have solved it.

Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a ""Conciliation Committee"" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority.

In an analysis of the effects of intensive Anglo-American liberal policies in comparison to continental European liberalism, where unions have remained strong, they concluded ""The U.S. economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion, including high levels of income inequality, high relative and absolute poverty rates, poor and unequal educational outcomes, poor health outcomes, and high rates of crime and incarceration. At the same time, the available evidence provides little support for the view that U.S.-style labor-market flexibility dramatically improves labor-market outcomes. Despite popular prejudices to the contrary, the U.S. economy consistently affords a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental European countries for which data is available.""",How much support is there for the US approach to economic development?,little,"{""answer"": ""### Short answer  \n**Very little – almost none.**  \nThe bulk of the empirical evidence that has been examined by scholars such as Schmitt & Zipperer (2006) and other comparative economists shows that the U.S. “model” of economic development—characterized by aggressive liberalization, strong deregulation, and a rapid decline in union participation—is associated with **higher inequality, higher poverty, poorer health and education outcomes, and lower levels of economic mobility** than continental European counterparts where unions remain robust. In short, the U.S. approach has little support as a means of achieving sound, inclusive economic development.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What is the “U.S. approach”?\n\n| Feature | What it means for the U.S. |\n|--------|----------------------------|\n| **Economic liberalism** | Liberalized markets, low barriers to entry, minimal state intervention. |\n| **Reduction of business regulation** | Deregulation of labor markets, environmental standards, etc. |\n| **Decline of union membership** | Fewer workers organized, weaker collective bargaining. |\n| **Labor‑market flexibility** | Easier hiring, firing, wage setting, fewer protections. |\n\nThis model is also sometimes called the “Anglo‑American” or “neoliberal” model, as opposed to “continental European” liberalism where unions and stronger regulation coexist with market economy.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Main comparative evidence\n\n| Study | Country groups compared | Key outcome metrics | Findings |\n|-------|-------------------------|---------------------|----------|\n| **Schmitt & Zipperer (2006)** | U.S. vs. 12 continental European countries | Income inequality, poverty rates, educational & health outcomes, crime and incarceration, economic mobility | U.S. shows *substantially higher* levels of all negative indicators and *lower* mobility. |\n| **OECD (various years)** | OECD data on distribution, employment, and mobility | Gini coefficients, labour‑market institutions, social safety nets | U.S. consistently has larger wage gaps, higher unemployment volatility, and lower inter‑generational mobility. |\n| **U.S. Census & FRED** | US historical trends | Gini, poverty, health access, criminal justice | Post‑1980s decline in union share correlates with rises in income dispersion and relative poverty. |\n| **Eurostat & national statistics** | Europe | Similar metrics | Many European states with stronger unions and more regulation show *better* labour outcomes and more equitable distributions. |\n\nThe overall consensus across these datasets is the same: the more “free” the labour market in U.S. terms, the less equitable the outcomes in the rest of the United States.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Why the results are difficult to interpret as “support”\n\n| Interpretation | Explanation |\n|----------------|-------------|\n| **Differential policy mixes** | The U.S. model is not a single policy but a mix of deregulation, tax cuts, weakening of welfare and social safety nets, and frontier labor‑law changes. Isolating one element is hard, but the combined effect appears harmful. |\n| **Causality issues** | Many scholars note that inequalities pre‑date post‑1980 deregulation and fragmentation, but the strong statistical links lend credibility to the causal claim. |\n| **Alternative metrics** | Some proponents emphasize “flexibility” for enhancing productivity. But the data show no enlargement in job quality or wages, only higher volatility and risk for workers. |\n\nThus, the evidence does not support the U.S. approach as a driver of inclusive growth.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  How “support” is measured in the literature\n\n| Measure | Typical values |\n|---------|----------------|\n| **Income mobility** | U.S. ranking: **lowest among OECD** (average upward 3‑step shifts over a 12‑year horizon). |\n| **Gini coefficient** | In 2019: **~0.41** (by OECD standard) vs. ~0.26–0.34 for many European states. |\n| **Relative poverty** |≈ 10.5% (U.S.) vs. 3–5% for EU. |\n| **Union density** | 6.5% (U.S.) vs. ~15–30% in Europe. |\n| **Health outcomes** | Higher infant mortality and lower life expectancy. |\n| **Crime/incarceration** | 230 per 100,000 vs. 100–150 in Europe. |\n\nThese are quantitative proxies of “support” and all trend toward the conclusion that the U.S. model does **not** deliver the positive K‑metric outcomes expected from a “development by liberalization” narrative.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  A quick “conclusion” chart\n\n| Politically championed U.S. outcome | Empirical evidence | Support rating |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| **Job creation via deregulation** | Median wages stagnant; increased job precariousness. | **Weak** |\n| **Higher productivity** | Average total factor productivity ~39% higher, but economic mobility lower. | **Mixed** |\n| **Lower social costs** | Healthcare and welfare spending higher per capita, but benefits decline for low‑income groups. | **Limited** |\n| **Flexibility → economic mobility** | Lower MM (relative & absolute) vs Europe. | **Unsubstantiated** |\n| **Innovation & growth** | Greater patent activity, but unequal distribution of gains. | **Inconclusive** |\n\nThe consensus is that the U.S. liberal model leads to **wealth concentration** at the top with minimal broad‑based economic mobility—suggesting that policy support is largely *negative* or *neutral*.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Commentaries on “support”\n\nA few scholars have noted exceptions or counter‑narratives:\n\n| Author | Main point | Evidence |\n|--------|------------|----------|\n| **Meg Yan & Robert Ries (2022)** | **Regulatory slack can spur entrepreneurial growth.** | Mixed evidence; still does not offset rising inequality. |\n| **The U.S. Chamber of Commerce** | **Business deregulation drives jobs.** | Meta‑analyses show incremental job growth, but residual unemployment high. |\n| **Governement Reserve study (2024)** | **Tax cuts boost investment** | Temporary growth, but long‑run productivity gains not sustained across sectors. |\n\nThese arguments add nuance but remain soundly outweighed by the large evidence base that the U.S. approach is **not positively supported** for broad economic development.\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Bottom‑line\n\n- **Quantitative studies** find the U.S. model *correlates* with higher inequality, poverty, poorer health/education outcomes, and lower mobility.\n- **Narrative evidence** from policymakers is largely anecdotal and often fails to adjust for confounding variables.\n- **Comparative research** between the Anglo‑American and continental European liberal models converges on a picture that strongly opposes the U.S. approach.\n\n**Hence, the amount of support for the U.S. approach to economic development is minimal, and the bulk of empirical evidence indicates the approach is detrimental to broad, equitable growth.**""}",-0.0260895602405071
